## Description

- My motivation for this project was to learn how to refactor code in HTML and CSS. 

- I built this project to further my knowledge on how to include semantic HTML, accessibility attributes, and how to refactor the CSS to reflect the order of elements in the HTML file. 

- By refactoring this code, I attempted to make it easier to read and follow the structure of the code. Before, the div elements made it difficult to follow the structure of the HTML file. Replacing the div elements with semantic HTML elements made it easier to navigate the code in HTML and CSS. I also included an ID attribute in the search-engine-optimization section so that the link would function properly, and I included alt image text for accessibility purposes. 

- I learned that semantic HTML elements are important for easier identification of what the code is doing and where. I learned that semantic HTML elements include header, body, main, section, nav, aside, footer, and more. I learned that you do not need to use an excessive number of selectors to achieve the same goal as using element (tag) selectors, and by removing those the CSS was easier to read and follow. 

- My instructor advised me to add here that I forgot to make commits as I worked through the project. All of my changes will be made in one commit, but this will be a mistake that I won't make in the future. 

## Installation

## Usage 

To use this webpage, you can click on any of the links in the navigation bar to direct you to the sections that provide information on that particular section. For example, if you click on "Search Engine Optimization", it will move you down the webpage so that section appears on your screen. 

## Credits

My tutor, Alexis Gonzalez, helped me with removing the "hero" and "content" class attributes. He also helped me revise some of my alt attributes to be more descriptive and revise some of my CSS comments.
